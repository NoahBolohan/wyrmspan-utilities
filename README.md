# Wyrmspan Utilities

The web app can be found [here](https://noahbolohan.github.io/wyrmspan-utilities/).

The Wyrmspan Utilities application includes tools to support playing the Wyrmspan board game. The score sheets found in this application come equipped with functionality to submit scores to a personal Google Sheets document. However, submitting to a Google Sheets document requires setting one up for yourself. You can do so by following [this guide](https://github.com/NoahBolohan/wingspan-utilities/blob/main/how_to_submit_scores_to_google_sheets.md).

The Wyrmspan Utilities application includes the following features:

- **Score sheet (Automa):** Digital score sheet for games versus the Automa.
- **Score sheet:** Digital score sheet for games of 2 to 5 players.

## Coming soon

- **Automa tracker:** Simulate all of the Automa's actions and functionality in a game versus the Automa. Using this tool requires only the physical components the player uses (i.e., you no longer use the Automa cards).
