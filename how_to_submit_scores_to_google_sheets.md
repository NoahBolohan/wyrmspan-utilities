# How to submit Wyrmspan scores to a Google Sheet

Note: This guide is derived from jamiewilson's [form-to-google-sheets repository](https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets).

This page will guide you through the following:

+ Creating a Google Sheet to store your Wyrmspan game scores
+ Deploying a Google Web App to post data to your Sheet
+ Attaching the deployed App script to the score sheets found throughout this Wyrmspan Utilities application

From start to finish, this guide should take approx. 10-15 minutes to follow. It is also **necessary** to follow this guide on a desktop browser (Google Apps Script is hard to access/use on mobile).
